<h1 align="center">Brian's Discord Client</h1>

<p align="center">Run Discord in your console, all powered by the Discord API (and Node.js)!<br><br></p>

## Features
- Allows you to send and read messages of any custom channel ID (including DM's)!
- Automatically search for servers you're in to read and send messages.
- Download images from any URL, including the Discord CDN.
- Powered by Node.js and the officical Discord API

## Installation
To install the client on your device, enter the following commands into your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BrianWalczak/Brians-Discord-Client.git; # Clone the repository from GitHub
$ cd Brians-Discord-Client # Enter the extracted repository folder
```

Before continuing any further, you'll first have to get your Discord account token which will be used for API requests.
To get your token, you can execute this code on a discord.com Chrome tab: `alert((webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken());`

Once you find your Discord token and copy it to your clipboard, open up token.txt with `sudo nano token.txt` and paste your key. Then, run these commands to finish installation: 
```
$ npm install # Install libraries and dependencies
$ node . # Start the Node program
```
Once you run ``node .``, the Discord client will start automatically!
